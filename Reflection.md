Through all the practice I realized how imoprtant is to make sure all the functions sand code is right before launching an app. 
And sometimes some little details just like negative numbers in this case for a banking app can mean a whole conflict if a real user would be using this app. 
As well as small fixes around the app just so it could be admitted just for testings.
